# Matrix Todo

## Getting Started

This project is an extended To Do app made with Flutter. It implements traditional "to do" functionality to add, edit, and delete items. It also leverages the Eisenhower Matrix strategy for prioritization.

## Additional functionality

- Matrix: Items are drag and dropped to indicate importance level and urgency level using a 2x2 matrix. It utilizes the Eisenhower Matrix time management theory to triage tasks.
- Sort: Items are sorted based on their Eisenhower Matrix designation.
- Statistics: A percentage breakdown of the percentage of each type of task is displayed in an animated pie chart. This allows users to determine if they are using their time wisely.

## Background

This is my first flutter app. This project was made over two days as a way to learn flutter while on a vacation.
